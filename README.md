PROJECT 2: 

# AI-Powered Learning Content Generator

This project is an autonomous agent-based platform that automatically generates structured, engaging, and educational content from a single topic input. It is built using [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) and designed for applications in learning platforms, microlearning tools, and EdTech environments.

## Overview

When a user provides a topic (e.g., "Introduction to Blockchain"), a team of AI agents collaborates to:

1. Research the topic
2. Generate structured learning content
3. Edit the content for clarity and quality
4. Create flashcards for revision
5. Generate a quiz to assess understanding

3. Edit and polish the material
4. Generate flashcards
5. Build a quiz

The workflow uses `verbose=2` for detailed logging and monitoring.
