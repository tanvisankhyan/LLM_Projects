1. AI Alignment with Human Intent (Real-Time Value Learning)

Problem: One of the most difficult challenges in AI alignment is ensuring that AI systems truly understand and align with human intentions, especially as those intentions evolve.
Project Idea: Create an AI that can learn human values in real time during its interaction with people. Rather than assuming predefined human values, the AI would actively observe, understand, and adapt to the shifting moral or ethical preferences of its human users. For example, as a user interacts with the system, the AI could adjust its behavior based on feedback or subtle signals indicating human preferences and values.
Impact: This could revolutionize the way AI systems align with human needs, particularly in long-term, dynamic environments where values are not static but evolve over time.


2. ImprovAI

A tool that generates funny and creative dialogue, jokes, or improv scenarios based on user inputs (e.g., settings, characters, themes).
